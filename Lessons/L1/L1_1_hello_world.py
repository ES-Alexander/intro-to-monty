# Recall that variables are set using:
variable_name = 'value'

# As a note, it's a programming convention that the first thing any programmer
# does when learning a new language is to print the words "hello world".


# Set a variable called "my_first_string" to be the string "hello world":


# Now run this module, using the menu-bar at the top, or the F5 keyboard key,
# and print the my_first_string variable in the console, using the print
# command. (e.g. print(variable_name) ).
