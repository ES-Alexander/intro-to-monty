# L8 Practice

    Return to the lesson 6 examples and modify the Matrix class so it uses deep 
    copies for __init__, get_rows, get_columns, add_row, and add_column, such 
    that no user inputs are used directly, and no method outputs allow direct 
    access to the internal state of a Matrix instance.

# Recursion/Loops
'''
    Write a recursive method max_sort1 to take a list of numbers and sort it 
    from largest to smallest. The end result should be returned, and the 
    original list should not be modified.
    
    Then write max_sort2 to perform the same function as max_sort1, but using a
    traditional (for/while) loop instead. Do not use the existing 'max' function
    in max_sort1 or max_sort2.
    
    e.g. a = [1,3.5,2], b = max_sort(a) -> b = [3.5,2,1], a = [1,3.5,2]
