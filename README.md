TEMPORARY DISCLAIMER:

This is a beta version, without all intended features implemented. Presently I am working through writing all the notes, after which I intend to write a number of checkable examples for each lesson, along with some more challenging problems for every few lessons. Beyond this I hope to develop the full set of lessons into an interactive application, but priority is on the completion of lesson notes and exercises. If I have missed any content you feel should be covered, feel free to raise it as an issue and I will respond as I am able, potentially adding the requested content where appropriate.

DISCLAIMER:

This introductory python course is intended for near-beginners of programming, who understand the very basics of possible variable/object types, and that’s about it. More advanced programmers may still benefit from the detailed explanations, but may also find the pace at times a little slow. These users are directed to the “python_dict.py” file to find a quick list of basic syntax and features, after which they may feel inclined to complete the examples and challenge tasks without reading the more extensive notes.


DISTRIBUTION:

Feel free to distribute this course at will, in the hopes it will help other aspiring programmers learn to program basic python, and perhaps be inspired to go further in their programming journey. In saying that, please include this README out of respect for the original author, to include a meaningful introduction to new participants, and preferably also maintain the course as a complete package. 

DO NOT distribute this course for economic benefit or individual personal gain. The course is intended as free-access, and its usage should not be restricted or used for the profits of any individual or organisation.


USAGE:

The course is separated into lessons, with each lesson containing a number of files, including notes, examples, an example checker, and occasionally challenge problems. The intention for users following the course’s progression is to read the relevant notes on syntax and programming theory prior to completing each set of examples, and each challenge problem. Notes can be referred back to at any point, and once examples have been completed and passed all checks, they should also serve as a valuable reference for recalling certain features and aspects of syntax.


REQUIREMENTS:

The course is intended for use with the IDLE integrated development environment (IDE), although more advanced users are welcome to use alternative IDEs if they feel more confident doing so. IDLE can be freely downloaded from the internet, and no other programs or files should be required beyond those provided with the course materials.


Best of luck to any and all participants in their coding,

ES Alexander.
